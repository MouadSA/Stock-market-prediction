# Stock-market-prediction
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for predicting stock prices based on historical stock data. The goal is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting future stock prices using past performance.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Historical stock data is preprocessed and normalized using MinMax scaling to prepare it for model training.

Model Development: The LSTM architecture is used to construct the predictive model, leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics on both training and testing datasets to assess its predictive performance.

Sliding Window Technique: Sliding window techniques are implemented to create input-output pairs from the sequential data, enabling the model to learn patterns over time.

Checkpointing: Checkpoints are used to save the model's best performance during training, ensuring the ability to restore the optimal model state for future use.

Technologies Used:
